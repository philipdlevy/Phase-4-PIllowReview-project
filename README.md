This is my frontend and backend for my pillow review application. The objective of this project is to showcase the work I did in Flatiron School for my fourth project. In this project, once you have created an account, you can create a pillow item that you and others can leave reviews on. You can see all of the items anyone has created or see the items only you have left reviews on. 

# Requirements
* node version v16.13.1
* npm version 8.6.0

## How to use
### For backend
* Fork and clone respository, then run "bundle install" for gem dependencies. 
* Then run "rails s" to start server.


### For frontend
* Run "npm install --prefix client"
* Then run "npm start --prefix client" to start the application on http://localhost:4000
